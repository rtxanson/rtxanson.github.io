get you around is your guidebook and a dictionary. While trying to get around,
you find you have to look a word up here and there. Let&#8217;s say the word you see
is <em>gažaldahkii</em>, but looking through the dictionary you don&#8217;t find anything.
You see words in the area, but since you don&#8217;t know anything about the
language, nothing can really tell you that <em>gažaldat</em> is what you&#8217;re looking&nbsp;for. </p>
<p>Another situation: you&#8217;re on your mobile phone, and you see a word <em>geaŧŧu</em>,
but the keyboard on your phone won&#8217;t support typing any of these characters.
How do you find the word without typing&nbsp;it?</p>
<p>These are common problems in many of the world&#8217;s languages, and this situation
is what has motivated creating all sorts of tools for machines to handle text:
tools that take a word and return a &#8220;dictionary form&#8221; or <em>lemma</em>, and heck,
even spellcheckers can be repurposed to handle the second scenario. But, these
tools frequently aren&#8217;t combined with dictionaries to allow for additional use
cases that are a little more&nbsp;human.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that it&#8217;s important, but why is it? Northern Saami,
the language <em>gažaldahkii</em> and <em>geaŧŧu</em> come from is a good example:
<em>lemmas</em> are exceedingly rare in running texts in Northern Saami. In one
North Saami evaluation (<a href="#refs">Antonsen et al., 2009</a>), a text of 252,461 words
was run against a dictionary of 99,071 lemmas. Even with that amount of
lemmas, you&#8217;d expect good coverage, right? No, <strong>only 7.9%</strong> of the
words returned results. This is exceptionally bad, and it means more or
less that if you want to look up a word in a dictionary for this
language, you better know how the words&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The statistics get better for other languages: the same study evaluated a
Finnish text, and a Norwegian text, and found (unsurprisingly) that Norwegian
resulted in the best, and Finnish was only a step up (but with a perhaps
humorous twist, where there are more lemmas in the dictionary, and less
wordforms in the text). The results are listed&nbsp;below:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th><th> North Saami</th><th> Finnish</th><th> Norwegian</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Words in text</th><td> 252,461</td><td> 45,155</td><td> 64,944</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Lemmas in dictionary</th><td> 99,071</td><td> 94,111</td><td> 38,983</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Success rate</th><td> 7.9%</td><td> 10.0%</td><td> 30.5%</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The authors of this particular paper saw this as a reason to go one step
further than simple wordforms, so they created dictionaries that
included additional wordforms– which is a large step up from not even
including wordforms at all. However, even this isn&#8217;t enough: wordform
lists can&#8217;t handle dynamic compounding (a process whereby all sorts of
words are combined into on, and thus may not be frequent enough for a
dictionary), because the number of wordforms you&#8217;d have to pregenerate
would be&nbsp;immense.</p>
<p><strong>But, what to do?</strong> Northern Saami already has great tools for analysing words
and even sentences (with ridiculously amazing coverage rates), it has a
spellchecker, and all these systems are extensible, flexible and in active use
already in learning tools.  Crucially, these tools are open-source and free
(open your lexica, people!). All that&#8217;s left really, is to bring them&nbsp;together.</p>
<h3>Neahttadigisánit</h3>
<p>Over the last year, I wrote a dictionary application in Python, using Flask, to
bring these resources together. The general set of steps&nbsp;is:</p>
<p>1.) User enters a word
2.) Morphological analyser looks it up, and returns possible wordforms
3.) Wordforms are looked up in the dictionary
4.) User sees <em>beana</em> when they were searching for <em>beatnaga</em></p>
<p>Some additional features were necessary however, and some of these were built in
to the morphological analyser by other members of the&nbsp;team: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compound words are split up, thus they may be searched for in the lexicon
 individually or separately. If there is nothing in the dictionary for the
 whole word, then the individual parts are looked&nbsp;up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Word derivations are split up in the same way: if there is no lexicalized
 form in the dictionary, then the user sees the stem. Thus: <em>gaskabeaivvit</em>
 &#8216;dinner&#8217; still returns dinner, even though this word is a plural form of
 another (<em>gaskabeaivi</em>&nbsp;&#8216;noon&#8217;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A separate analyser is available so users can select for what we call
 &#8220;social media Sámi&#8221;: accepting <em>a d t s n z c</em> as possible input for <em>á đ ŧ š
 ŋ ž č</em>, but also offering a wider range of additional dialectical and spelling&nbsp;variants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Norwegian side of dictionaries we have, we also merged Nynorsk and
 Bokmål in the input, so, if you enter a Nynorsk word, you still end up with a
 definition. One of the reasons here is that users may not be aware that a word
 is a Nynorsk word, but are only aware that the text is Norwegian– maybe
 they&#8217;re a speaker of a language that is spoken in Norway, but live in Sweden
 or&nbsp;Finland.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting end product, <a href="http://sanit.oahpa.no">Neahttadigisánit</a> is available online, and
has since seen quite a large bit of use. We also store lookups and use them
occasionally to add new lexical entries and morphological data. In addition to
dictionaries for Northern Saami, we&#8217;ve also released another for <a href="http://baakoeh.oahpa.no">South Saami
and Norwegian</a>, and are currently developing dictionaries for other
minority Uralic languages (Kven, Olonets Karelian, Nenets, Komi, Livonian, and
I&#8217;m probably forgetting a few), with translations to Russian, Finnish, Latvian,&nbsp;Estonian.</p>
<p>We also wanted these to work on mobile, so we used <a href="bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a> 
to produce a responsive design that fits on a variety of devices for little
work which meant that there was more time for feature implementation, less time
spent on all sorts of browser interoperability&nbsp;issues.</p>
<p>One last thing that we decided to do was to create an <span class="caps">API</span> so we could interact
with these dictionaries via a JavaScript plugin that&#8217;s built into a learning
system, and available via bookmarklet: this enables people to read texts
without having to go back and forth between what they&#8217;re reading, and a
dictionary– entries just pop up when you click a&nbsp;word.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaways</strong> however, are many: this is extensible to other languages
(although we haven&#8217;t gotten any right-to-left languages in yet, as the initial
languages are Uralic), and it wasn&#8217;t all that hard to do. This enables learners
and speakers of all levels to interact: the social media feature also means
that it&#8217;s easier for non-native speakers of a language to read a language as
though they were: the system can make all the substitutions to turn <em>cakca</em>
into <em>čakča</em>, like native speakers do on the&nbsp;fly.</p>
<p>The other major point is that you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> an amazing analyzer or an
amazing lexicon to reap the benefits of this kind of system for a language. For
instance, if you have a language where nouns have 9 forms, adding even one word
to these systems means a little&nbsp;more.</p>
<h3>Reception</h3>
<p>Neahttadigisánit made it into <a href="http://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/news-and-events/events/conferences/2013/nodalida/index.html">NoDaLida 2013</a>, where I gave a
talk along with Trond Trosterud, and since launch it has been seeing
some amazing Google Analytics statistics. It seems like a tool like this
was something people just needed– maybe you&#8217;d like to try it for your&nbsp;languages?</p>
