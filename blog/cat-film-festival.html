                    <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his summer, I ended up at the second annual Internet Cat Video Festival, which
moved to a new and larger venue, the Minnesota State Fair. This year&#8217;s festival
was also the launch of a new international aspect: planners stated that it will
be travelling to small and large venues across the world (the schedule is yet
to be released). The festival has even spun off in some other locations too,
with Oakland hosting its own in May of&nbsp;2013.</p>
<p><strong>Surprise festival.</strong> Maybe you attended the festival, planning on cat videos
from the opening time to the absolute finish, not expecting that the inclusion
of &#8220;festival&#8221; in the event name would result in live performances, and other
festival accoutrements from local businesses (the Kitty Cat Klub, naturally
among them). After arriving promptly at the beginning, and confronted with
musical numbers, a friend and I discovered to our dismay that the actual video
portion was shockingly far off into the evening. But, we stuck it out and well,
the hour and a half of solid cat videos more or less placated us— we could no
longer complain about the exceptionally awkward second musical&nbsp;act.</p>
<p><strong>Human aspects and cat celebrities</strong> were by no means absent. The festival
took time to honor those humans who turned on the camera and pointed it at
their cats. More often than not, the human owners and videographers were 
surprised to end up in the place they had. <em>Grumpy Cat</em> (Tardar
Sauce) was particularly of this origin: his owners simply uploaded a photo one
day to Reddit, and boom, instant celebrity. Grumpy Cat&#8217;s presence on stage was
for his internet adorers as a Papal visit would be to Catholics, except in this
case, the Pope met with Buddha: <a href="http://goodjob.lilbub.com/">Little Bub</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Film?</strong> A quick peek around Twitter during and after the festival provided
some skepticism from self-identified film people that maybe &#8220;film&#8221; wasn&#8217;t the
right way to describe the medium. What was it about these short and widely viewed
clips— sometimes humorous, sad, or even introspective— that qualified them as
film? This question is the answer.
One could further question what even qualifies memes as art. Well, for starters, cat films,
lolcats, and all other kinds of memes, static or dynamic, are a form of
self-expression. There&#8217;s room for admiration in that a quick glance at one of
these pieces is all that is necessary to understand the meaning, the context,
and where the author/artist (<em>qua</em> feline) is coming&nbsp;from.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, it&#8217;s art. Yes, it&#8217;s film.</strong> To not want to call it either is to be a
little defensive. It shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for such a broad domain to take in
some new territory, so, why even patrol these borders? To deny entry to this
new member is to devalue the whole of what is film or&nbsp;art.</p>
<p>Maybe the average animated gif, or clip on YouTube of cats in their element
does not seem like enough to qualify individual pieces as art though: and
indeed, the film festival did mostly show a curated set of films that
demonstrated some intentionality (amongst them,
<a href="http://youtu.be/0M7ibPk37_U">Henri</a>)— but, there was time for many of the
incidental recordings of cats reaction to their environment.  Including these
with the more intentional set of films demonstrated that by participating in
the meme, the uploaders are participating in the form as a whole. So yes, they
too, become art. It is thus, just as important to recognize the movement as it is
the individual&nbsp;members.</p>
<p><a class="inset-img-left" href="/media/img/illus/cat-film-festival-cat-makes-art.jpg">
    <img src="/media/img/illus/cat-film-festival-cat-makes-art.jpg"
         class="inset-img-left"></img>
</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important that these things are being presented (for the second
time) in a serious (or well, official) context, which the Walker Art Museum has
made space for. By snapping up lolcats and the relevant tags on YouTube, the
museum has given an endorsement to internet cat <em>film</em> as worthy of standing
alongside other artists and genres within its&nbsp;walls.</p>
<p><strong>If the festival should grace your town</strong>, just go. You can watch the whole
lineup on YouTube (or Vimeo, or whatever), but the experience is key.  Much
like Rocky Horror, where the audience particip—— etcetera makes the whole shebang
enjoyable, you might find a larger audience than could fit on your own sofa
will thoroughly improve your enjoyment. Oh, and, leave your allergies at&nbsp;home.</p>                </div>
